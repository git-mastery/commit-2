# commit-2

This continues to build upon what you might have done in [commit-1](https://github.com/git-mastery/commit-1) and in the [tutorial](https://git-mastery.github.io/website/docs/commits/).

## Goal

Add a new file (you can call it whatever you want!) and put in any non-empty content that you want!

Commit this change.

Edit the same file and make another non-whitespace change.

Commit this change again.

## Hints

To quickly create a new file with some content, you can try

```sh
echo 'Hello world' >> hello.txt
```
